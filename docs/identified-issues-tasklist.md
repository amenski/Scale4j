## 1. Resize Algorithm Performance & Quality

**Issue:** `ResizeOperation.scaleImage()` uses `Image.getScaledInstance()`, which is known for poor performance, high memory consumption, and suboptimal visual quality. The rendering hints set on the `Graphics2D` context may not be respected by this legacy method.

**Impact:** Slow resize operations, especially on large images; lower output quality compared to modern interpolation techniques.

**Task:** Replace `getScaledInstance` with `AffineTransformOp` using configurable interpolation (nearest‑neighbor, bilinear, bicubic). Implement a dedicated high‑quality scaler that respects the `ResizeQuality` enum.

**Suggested Implementation:**
```java
private static BufferedImage scaleImage(BufferedImage source, int targetWidth, int targetHeight,
                                         ResizeQuality quality) {
    BufferedImage dest = new BufferedImage(targetWidth, targetHeight, source.getType());
    AffineTransform at = AffineTransform.getScaleInstance(
        (double) targetWidth / source.getWidth(),
        (double) targetHeight / source.getHeight()
    );
    RenderingHints hints = new RenderingHints(RenderingHints.KEY_INTERPOLATION,
        getInterpolationHint(quality));
    AffineTransformOp op = new AffineTransformOp(at, hints);
    return op.filter(source, dest);
}
```

## 2. Inadequate Test Coverage

**Issue:** The project contains only one test class (`Scale4jTest`) with basic unit tests. Missing tests for edge cases, invalid parameters, async operations, watermarking, and integration scenarios.

**Impact:** Low confidence in correctness, risk of regression when refactoring, difficult to ensure compatibility with imgscalr.

**Task:** Expand test suite to cover:
- Each operation (`ResizeOperation`, `CropOperation`, `RotateOperation`, `PadOperation`) with boundary values.
- `Scale4jBuilder` chaining and error handling.
- `AsyncScale4j` with mocked executor.
- Watermark classes (text and image) with various positions and opacities.
- Image I/O (`ImageLoader`, `ImageSaver`) with unsupported formats.
- Property‑based testing (using JUnit‑Quickcheck) to validate invariants.

---

## 3. Missing Performance Benchmarks

**Issue:** The `scale4j-benchmarks` module exists but contains no JMH benchmarks. No performance baseline exists to compare against imgscalr or to measure improvements.

**Impact:** Inability to quantify performance impact of changes; cannot claim performance superiority over deprecated library.

**Task:** Implement JMH benchmarks for:
- Resize at different sizes and quality levels.
- Crop, rotate, pad operations.
- Chained operations (typical workflows).
- Async throughput with virtual threads vs. thread pool.
- Memory usage and GC pressure.

Store benchmark results in `docs/benchmarks/` and integrate with CI (run on schedule).

---

## 4. No EXIF Metadata Preservation

**Issue:** Scale4j does not preserve EXIF (or other) metadata when loading, processing, and saving images. This is a critical requirement for photography applications.

**Impact:** Loss of orientation, camera settings, geotags, etc., making the library unsuitable for many real‑world image pipelines.

**Task:** Integrate a lightweight metadata library (e.g., Apache Sanselan, TwelveMonkeys ImageIO) to read metadata from source images and re‑attach it to processed outputs. At a minimum, preserve orientation tags and apply automatic rotation.

---

## 5. Limited Image Format Support

**Issue:** Core module relies on ImageIO’s built‑in formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP). WebP and AVIF extensions are declared but not implemented.

**Impact:** Cannot process modern formats without additional manual setup; extensions are essentially placeholders.

**Task:** Complete the `scale4j-ext-webp` and `scale4j-ext-avif` modules by:
- Adding required ImageIO plugin dependencies (e.g., `com.github.jai-imageio:jai-imageio‑webp`, `com.github.romankh3:imageio‑avif`).
- Providing `ImageReader`/`ImageWriter` registrations.
- Documenting usage and fallback behavior.

---

## 6. Error Handling & Logging

**Issue:** Exceptions are generic (`IllegalArgumentException`, `RuntimeException`, `IOException`) with minimal context. No logging facade or configuration hooks.

**Impact:** Difficult to diagnose failures in production; cannot integrate with application monitoring.

**Task:** Introduce a dedicated exception hierarchy (`Scale4jException`, `ImageLoadException`, `ImageProcessException`, etc.) with detailed messages and optional cause chains. Provide a `Scale4jLogger` interface (SLF4J optional) for debug/trace output.

---

## 7. Memory Inefficiency

**Issue:** Each operation creates a new `BufferedImage` instance; intermediate images are not reused or cached. For chains of operations, this leads to unnecessary memory churn.

**Impact:** Higher memory footprint and GC pressure when processing multiple images or large batches.

**Task:** Implement scratch buffer optimization to reuse a single transient `BufferedImage` buffer within each builder chain when dimensions match. This eliminates unnecessary allocations for chained operations.

**Status:** ✅ Implemented via scratch buffer technique (see README).

---

## 8. Missing Batch Processing API

**Issue:** The library processes single images only. No built‑in support for processing collections of images with parallel streams or bulk async operations.

**Impact:** Users must write boilerplate for batch operations, missing optimization opportunities.

**Task:** Add `Scale4j.batch()` method returning a `BatchProcessor` that can apply the same operation chain to multiple images, optionally parallelized. Integrate with `AsyncScale4j` for non‑blocking batch workflows.

---

## 9. No Image Filters / Effects

**Issue:** Only basic geometric operations (resize, crop, rotate, pad) and watermarks are supported. Common image filters (blur, sharpen, brightness, contrast, grayscale) are missing.

**Impact:** Library cannot replace more full‑featured image processing solutions; users need to combine multiple libraries.

**Task:** Create a `filter` package with operations based on `ConvolveOp`, `LookupOp`, and `RescaleOp`. Provide builder methods for common filters (`.blur(radius)`, `.sharpen()`, `.grayscale()`, `.brightness(factor)`).

---

## 10. Watermark Positioning Bug

**Issue:** `WatermarkPosition.calculate()` returns incorrect Y coordinates for `TOP_LEFT`, `TOP_CENTER`, `TOP_RIGHT` (adds `watermarkHeight` instead of 0). This causes watermarks to be placed lower than intended.

**Impact:** Text and image watermarks appear shifted downward, especially noticeable for top positions.

**Task:** Fix coordinate calculation in `WatermarkPosition`. For top positions, `y` should be `0 + margin` (or `watermarkHeight` for bottom?). Verify all nine positions with unit tests.

---

## 11. Missing Documentation for Extension Development

**Issue:** The plugin architecture is mentioned in the README but there is no guide on how to write custom operations or format extensions.

**Impact:** Third‑party developers cannot extend the library easily, limiting ecosystem growth.

**Task:** Write a `EXTENSIONS.md` guide in the `docs/` folder explaining:
- The `Operation` interface (if exists) or how to add custom `UnaryOperator<BufferedImage>`.
- Registering new image formats via `ImageIO`.
- Packaging extensions as separate modules.

---

## 12. CI/CD Does Not Run Benchmarks

**Issue:** The GitHub Actions workflow only runs unit tests; benchmarks are not executed regularly.

**Impact:** Performance regressions may go unnoticed.

**Task:** Add a scheduled CI job (nightly) that runs JMH benchmarks and compares results against a baseline, failing if significant degradation occurs. Store benchmark history as artifacts.
